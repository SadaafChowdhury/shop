	<h4><b>Dainty chic</b></h4>
	<p style="color:red;">Tasfia Huda</p>
	<p style="text-align:right;">Published at 03:33 pm May 29th, 2019</p>
	<p style="font-size:20px;">Samrin Hassan is a student of North South University, and it’s been a year since she started her own label. This month, she sat 
	down with Avenue T to discuss her journey and the upcoming Eid collection from her line.</p>


	<p><b>What was your biggest obstacle in becoming a designer and how did you overcome it? Tell us about your journey.</b></p>
	<p>The biggest obstacle was that I was afraid I wouldn’t receive a good response from the customers or I won’t be
	able to satisfy my customers with good quality or price. In order to ensure my fears did not turn out to be true,
	I made sure I made quality dresses and priced them according to the customers’ expectations. It has been a wonderful
	journey throughout and it’s still going pretty well. Even though I did not have a huge customer base in the beginning,
	I was able to satisfy their needs. That was the most beautiful feeling.</p>
	
	<p><b>What sets you and your label apart from other such designers?</b></p>
	<p>Samrin Hassan tries to provide not just glamourous dresses but also comfortable ones. The designs are mostly based 
	on what I would like to wear or design for myself.</p>
	
	<p><b>With Eid-ul-Fitr right around the corner, what new designs are you currently working on?</b></p>
	<p>I’m mostly working with light colours like pastels to beat the heat in Dhaka. I have introduced dark colours as 
	well because not everyone prefers pastel coloured dresses. As everyone likes something that’s a little gorgeous for 
	Eid but not too heavy, Samrin Hassan tries to provide minimalistic designs along with a touch of comfort. I am currently 
	playing a lot with pearls and sequins for the upcoming collection, along with with contrasting Muslin dupattas.</p>
	
	<p><b>What have been the most popular designs among your clients?</b></p>
	<p>The best selling outfit of Samrin Hassan is the mauve kurti with silver sequins and cut work along with a mauve 
	dupatta. Also, all the high low gowns are quite trending at the moment, in all colours.</p>
	
	<p><b>How has been people’s response to your designs so far?</b></p>
	<p>In the beginning it was a little difficult to capture the customer’s’ attention but with time, the response
	has been immense. So much, that sometimes it gets difficult to coordinate all the deliveries.</p>
	
	<p><b>Tell us about the materials that you’re using. What kind of price range should a potential client expect while ordering from you?</b></p>
	<p>I use a variety of materials handpicked by myself so that there are no faults in any of them. Starting from double georgette to muslin
	or chiffon, I use it all depending on the design. My price range starts from Tk3,500 to Tk8,000.</p>
	
	<p><b>Any future plans or exclusives that you'd like to share with the readers of Avenue T?</b></p>
	<p>I have been working on a few exclusives that will be coming up this week for Eid. I can assure you that there will be unique pieces uploaded everyday!</p>
